### Description

This code uses API to get/set properties of most any combobox. I have designed it to work as an object so that you can just input the handle of your combobox and get/set the properties. Sample Included of course.
 
### More Info
 
you can input your own combobox handle in the sample or you can just use the default given in the sample.

### API Declarations

```
quite a few.
I am currently in the process of making classes for Textbox,Listbox, and Command button. since this site's voting is based 70%+ on GUI i decided to make a sample app to use it. please vote on the class itself if you will, comments would be nice also.
